# Project Overview
This project analyzes key factors that affect crop yields for Rice, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Sugarcane, Barley, and Soybean across Nigeria, USA, India, Brazil, and China. By examining crop performance, regional practices, and the impact of weather, the aim is to identify strategies for boosting productivity and reducing waste. The goal is to provide practical recommendations for farmers and regions to grow food more sustainably and efficiently.
SQL was used for data cleaning and analysis, with Power BI employed to create dynamic, interactive dashboards that highlight key insights.

# Methodology
For this project, I used SQL for data cleaning and analysis and Microsoft Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations to explore factors affecting crop yields and productivity across various countries.

# Data Cleaning
In this phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Imported the Data into MySQL Workbench using the Import Table Wizard
2. Checked for null values and duplicate records, ensuring data quality, and standardized the data for consistency and analysis

# Exploratory Data Analysis
I used SQL to conduct the following analyses on the data:

- How many crops are there?
- What is the total yield for each crop?
- Which region has the highest yield for each crop?
- How many countries are there in the dataset?
- What is the average annual rainfall for each region?
- How many seasons are there?
- How do average temperatures vary by region and season?
- Which regions experienced the highest total rainfall?
- How many fertilizer types are there?
- What is the total fertilizer usage by type?
- What are the yearly trends in fertilizer usage (Kgs/Ha)?
- Which crops receive the most fertilizer application?
- Which region uses the most fertilizer overall?
- How many pesticide types are there?
- What is the total pesticide application rates by type (L/Ha)?
- What are the yearly trends in pesticide application (L/Ha)?
- Which crops receive the most pesticide application?
- How does rainfall affect crop yield?
- How does temperature affect crop yield?

The SQL script is available in the repository for reference.

# Recommendations

1. **Crop Management:**  
â€¢ **Expand Rice Cultivation:** Focus on increasing Rice cultivation in high-yield, favorable regions.  
â€¢ **Diversify Cultivation:** Introduce modern farming techniques and resilient crop varieties to improve yields in underperforming regions like Central USA.

2. **Weather Adaptation:**  
â€¢ **Rainfall Efficiency:** Invest in rainwater harvesting and soil moisture management in high rainfall areas; use efficient irrigation in moderate rainfall regions.  
â€¢ **Temperature Management:** Use heat-tolerant crops and improved irrigation in hot regions like the USA and Brazil.  
â€¢ **Seasonal Strategies:** Align planting schedules with Monsoon and Summer seasons for optimal yields.

3. **Fertilizer Optimization:**  
â€¢ **Nitrogen Management:** Optimize nitrogen use to avoid over-application and soil depletion; balance with complementary nutrients like phosphorus and potassium.  
â€¢ **Promote Organic Fertilizers:** Focus on organic fertilizers to improve soil health and reduce chemical dependence.  
â€¢ **Precision Agriculture:** Use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to identify nutrient-deficient areas and apply fertilizers selectively.

4. **Pesticide Usage:**  
â€¢ **Targeted Spraying:** Apply pesticides only in pest hotspots to reduce overall application and explore Integrated Pest Management (IPM).  
â€¢ **Optimal Timing:** Time pesticide applications for critical growth stages or high pest activity to minimize usage.  
â€¢ **Companion Planting:** Consider companion planting strategies (e.g., using marigolds to repel pests and deter nematodes) to reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, especially for crops like Soybeans and Barley, which have higher pesticide applications.
